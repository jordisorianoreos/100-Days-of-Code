# 🔡 Text to Morse Code Converter

The **Text to Morse Code Converter** is a straightforward project that takes text input and translates it into Morse code. It’s a simple yet effective way to practice string manipulation and dictionary-based lookups.

## ✨ Features

- **Text Input**:
  - Users can input text in plain English.
  - Supports letters, numbers, and some punctuation marks.
- **Morse Code Output**:
  - Each character is followed by a space.
  - Words are separated by a `/` symbol.
- **User-Friendly Interface**:
  - Clear and concise input and output format.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**: For logic implementation and string manipulation.

## 🚀 Lessons Learned
1. **Dictionaries**: Built a custom dictionary for the Morse code alphabet, numbers, and basic punctuation.
2. **Morse Code Rules**: Learned the structure and formatting of Morse code.
3. **String Handling**: Reviewed and practiced working with strings, including:
   - Manipulating text input.
   - Formatting output to meet Morse code standards.

## 📝 Future Improvements
1. Add a **reverse converter** (Morse code to plain text).
2. Include support for additional punctuation and special characters.
3. Develop a simple **GUI** to make it more user-friendly.
