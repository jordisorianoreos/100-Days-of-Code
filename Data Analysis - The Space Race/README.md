# Data Analysis - The Space Race

## üìä Dataset Overview
This dataset was scraped from [NextSpaceFlight.com](https://nextspaceflight.com/launches/past/?page=1) and includes all space missions since the Space Race began in 1957 between the USA and the Soviet Union.

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps in Analysis

### Data Exploration
- Inspect the shape of the dataset, column names, and data types.
- Check for missing values or duplicates.

### Data Cleaning
- Drop junk columns and handle missing values in crucial columns (e.g., `Price` and `Date`).
- Convert price values to numeric and parse dates correctly.
