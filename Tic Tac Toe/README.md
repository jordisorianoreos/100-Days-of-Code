# ‚ùå‚≠ï Tic Tac Toe

The **Tic Tac Toe** project is a classic implementation of the popular two-player game. It uses Python's **NumPy** library to manage the game board efficiently and streamline win condition checks.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Game Board**:
  - The board is represented using a **NumPy array** for easy manipulation.
  - Automatically checks for winning combinations or a draw after each move.
  
- **Win and Draw Conditions**:
  - Checks for wins via:
    - **Rows**.
    - **Columns**.
    - **Diagonals**.
  - Detects a draw if the board is full and no one has won.

- **Input Validation**:
  - Ensures player input is:
    - **Valid** (within the board‚Äôs range).
    - **Available** (checks if the cell is already occupied).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Python**: For game logic and flow control.
- **NumPy**: To represent and manipulate the game board.

## üöÄ Lessons Learned
1. **NumPy Arrays**: Leveraged NumPy for efficient row, column, and diagonal checks.
2. **Game Logic**: Implemented win conditions, draw checks, and input validation.
3. **User Interaction**: Ensured a smooth experience with clear prompts and error messages.

## üìù Future Improvements
1. Develop a **single-player mode** with AI using algorithms like Minimax.
2. Create a **graphical interface** using Tkinter or PyGame.
3. Add options for **custom board sizes** (e.g., 4x4 or 5x5).

## üìÇ How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jordisorianoreos/100-Days-of-Code.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```bash
   cd "Tic Tac Toe"
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
