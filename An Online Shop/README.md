# 🛍️ An Online Shop

This project has been one of the most challenging for me so far, as creating web pages feels particularly labor-intensive. In the end, I successfully developed an e-commerce website for tech products, showcasing essential features of an online shop.

## ✨ Features

### 🛒 Product Listings
- Users need to **log in** to access the products.
- Products are displayed in a **grid format**, showing:
  - Product image.
  - Price.
  - A "See More" button leading to the product's details page.

### 📄 Product Details
- Each product has an individual page that includes:
  - A detailed description.
  - Stock availability.
  - Option to select a quantity and **add to the shopping cart**.

### 🛍️ Shopping Cart
- Displays a **summary of selected products**, including:
  - Names and images of the products.
  - Quantities.
  - Total prices.
- Includes a **Checkout button**:
  - Simulates a purchase.
  - Deducts the selected products from stock.
  - Moves the completed order to the "Your Orders" page.

### 📦 Order Management
- Users can view all their completed purchases on the **"Your Orders" page**, which shows a detailed summary of their past transactions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JS
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **Database**: SQLite for storing user data, products, and order history.

## 🚀 Lessons Learned
1. Building a full-fledged e-commerce site from scratch is both rewarding and demanding.
2. Planning reusable components and leveraging existing templates can save significant time.
3. Developing user authentication and simulating purchases helped solidify my understanding of backend programming and database interactions.

## 📝 Future Improvements
1. Add **real payment integration** with Stripe or another API.
2. Enhance UI/UX using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS.
3. Implement additional features such as user reviews, and wish lists.
