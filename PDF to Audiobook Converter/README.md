- Converts raw text from the PDF into an **MP3 file**.
- Output files are stored in a dedicated `outputs` folder.

### üìú PDF Text Extraction
- Employs the **PyPDF2** library to:
  - Read and extract the raw text content of the selected PDF.
  - Ensure accurate text processing for conversion.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **GUI**: Tkinter for the graphical interface.
- **Text Extraction**: PyPDF2 for reading PDF content.
- **Text-to-Speech**: edge_tts for generating high-quality audio files.
